These are some of the keyboard layouts I use when using Mac computers.

This is normally checked out in to `/Users/cjs/Library/Keyboard Layouts`.

The following tools can be helpful when working on keyboard layouts:
* [Key Codes](https://manytricks.com/keycodes/) for looking up key codes
* [Ukelele](http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele) layout editor

Other useful keyboard-related tools include:
* [USB Overdrive](http://www.usboverdrive.com/USBOverdrive/News.html)
  for using middle-mouse-button scrolling on a ThinkPad keyboard.
